<h1>Take part in an exciting new study into human memory and motor imagery</h1>
<p> UEA BCI is an EEG based experiment exploring human memory and detecting motor imagery using machine learning. By taking part you will not only push forward neurotechnological tools to help combat Dementia but also allow you to try playing tetris just with your mind!</p>	
<h2>Our Experiments</h2>
<p>We aim to combine modern time series based machine learning with EEG data in order to show that we can successfully classify different brain activities. In a single 90 minute visit you will help us detect the moment when the brain's memory stores information and demonstate how it can be used to control a computer in real time. By taking part  you will assist us in shaping future BCI projects and improve how we can train the brain's ability to prevent possible cognative decline.</p>
<h4>Word Recognition</h4>
This experiment aims to investigate how the brain remembers short-term information and whether we can identify if that information can be recalled in the future. You will be shown a series of common nouns whilst EEG recordings capure the electical patterns produced by your brain to remember them. Then, after a distraction, we will ask you to recall any words you can in any order. Our goal is to match the original signal to whether each word was recalled, to see if we can predict future recall just from the signal produced when reading the word. This experiment will allow us to further our understanding of how the brain encodes information upon perception.
<h4>Motor Imagery</h4>
<p>In this session you control a game of Tetris using thought alone. This experiment is into real-time detection and classification of imagined limb movements. We will first ask you to imagine moving either your left or right arm, or your feet, which we will use to train a machine learning model. We will then attempt to allow you to play tetris just using those movements by detecting and translating them to game commands. This expeirment will test how we can interpret motor intention and translate that to controlling a device purely with your mind.</p>

<h2>What this involves from a participant</h2>
We aim to show that our methods can be generalised across multiple people. Therefore we are looking for participants to take part in the experiments. This will involve a single session lasting approximately 1.5 hours at the EEG lab located at UEA. During this session an EEG cap will be placed on your head and your brain activity monitored whilst completing the two tasks.
<p>To take part in the experiments, please read through the files linked below, download and submit the provided consent form and book a slot. No prior knowledge of EEG, neuroscience, or machine learning is requried.</p>
<p>The person with the highest accuracy will win an Amazon gift card.</p>
