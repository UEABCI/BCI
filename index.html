<p> UEA BCI is an EEG bases experiment looking at how the human brain functions with two basic tasks, memory encoding and motor imagery.</p>	
<h2>Our Experiments</h2>
<p> We aim to combine modern time series based machine learning with EEG data in order to show that we can successfully classify different brain activities. To to this we have created two tasks that can be completed whilst recording EEG data.</p>
<h4>Word Recognition</h4>
This experiment aims to investigate how the brain remembers sort term information and whether we can identify if that information can be recalled in the future. To do this we have created a simple word recognition task where we first show a series of nouns, then after a delay see how many of the words can be successfully recalled. Out goal is to see if we can predict future recall of each word using the brain signal from when the word was first shown.
<h4>Motor Imagery</h4>
This experiment is into real time detection and classification of imagined limb movements. Our goal is to identify imagined left and right hand movements, as well as foot movement in real time. We then aim to demonstrate both accuracy and speed by using just those movements to play a simple game of Tetris.
<h2>What this involves from a participant</h2>
We aim to show that our methods can be generalised across multiple people. Therefore we are looking for participants to take part in the experiments. This will involve a single session lasting approximately 1.5 hours at the EEG lab located at UEA. During this session an EEG cap will be placed on your head and your brain activity monitored whilst completing the two tasks.
